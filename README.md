# INTRODUCTION

## HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION

A house price prediction data mining model is like a smart tool that tries to guess how much a house might cost based on certain information. Imagine you have a big box of data about houses, like their size, location, and number of rooms. The model looks at all this information and tries to find patterns to make a good guess about how expensive a house might be. It's kind of like having a friend who's really good at guessing prices and can help you figure out how much a house might sell for.

# DATA MINING TECHNIQUE

## PREDICTION

Prediction data mining techniques are methods used to make predictions or forecasts about future events or trends based on patterns and relationships in existing data. These techniques analyze historical data to identify patterns and use them to predict outcomes for new data.

In the context of your project on house price prediction, prediction refers to using data mining techniques to forecast the price of a house based on various factors or features. These factors may include the size of the house, its location, the number of rooms, the neighborhood's characteristics, and other relevant variables.

The goal of prediction in your project is to develop a model that can accurately estimate the price of a house based on these features. This model can then be used by real estate agents, buyers, or sellers to get a better understanding of how much a house is worth.

# MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION

Multiple linear regression is an extension of simple linear regression that allows for the prediction of a dependent variable based on two or more independent variables. In multiple linear regression, the relationship between the dependent variable (Y) and the independent variables (X1, X2, ..., Xn) is represented by the following equation:

\[ Y = b_0 + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + ... + b_nX_n + E \]

Where: <br>
•⁠  ⁠Y is the dependent variable (the variable we want to predict).<br>
•⁠  ⁠\( b_0 \) is the intercept (the value of Y when all independent variables are 0).<br>
•⁠  ⁠\( b_1, b_2, ..., b_n \) are the coefficients that represent the change in Y for a one-unit change in each independent variable.<br>
•⁠  ⁠\( X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \) are the independent variables (the variables used to predict Y).<br>
•⁠  ⁠E is the error term, representing the difference between the predicted and actual values of Y.<br>
The goal of multiple linear regression is to find the values of the coefficients ( \( b_0, b_1, ..., b_n \) ) that minimize the sum of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values of the dependent variable. This is typically done using the method of least squares.
Multiple linear regression is commonly used in data analysis and prediction tasks where there are multiple factors that may influence the outcome. It allows for the modeling of complex relationships between variables and can provide insights into how different factors contribute to the outcome of interest.
